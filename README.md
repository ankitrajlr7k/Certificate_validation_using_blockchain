# Certificate Validation Using Blockchain

## Overview

This project implements a certificate validation system using blockchain technology. The system ensures that certificates are cryptographically secured and stored immutably on the Ethereum blockchain, preventing unauthorized alterations and enhancing the overall integrity of issued credentials.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Smart Contracts
- **Tools & Libraries**: Web3, Ganache, Metamask, Nodemailer, JWT
- **Styling**: SASS

## Features

- **Decentralized Certificate Storage**: Certificates are stored on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts, ensuring immutability and security.
- **Certificate Issuance**: Institutions can generate and issue certificates to students.
- **Certificate Verification**: Users can verify the authenticity of certificates through the blockchain.
- **Email Notifications**: Generated certificates are sent to students via email.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JWT.
